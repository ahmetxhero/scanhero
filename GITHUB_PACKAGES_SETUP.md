## ðŸŽ¯ Understanding GitHub Packages

GitHub Packages is different from PyPI. Here's how to properly set it up:

## ðŸ”§ Correct Configuration

### Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)

GitHub Packages works best with GitHub Actions. Let me create a workflow for you:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish to GitHub Packages

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    
    - name: Install build dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install build twine
    
    - name: Build package
      run: python -m build
    
    - name: Publish to GitHub Packages
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
      run: twine upload dist/*
```

### Option 2: Manual Upload (Alternative)

For manual uploads, you need to:

1. **Enable GitHub Packages** in your repository settings
2. **Use the correct upload URL** (this varies by organization)
3. **Use GitHub token with packages:write permission**

This is the recommended approach for GitHub Packages. Let me create the workflow file:
